# Simon-Says-Game
Simon Says is a classic memory game where players must repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors. The game tests your concentration and short-term memory by challenging you to remember and reproduce the exact pattern shown by the game.

Each round, Simon adds one new step to the sequence. The player must follow along in the correct order—one mistake and the game ends!
